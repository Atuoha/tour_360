          'The Eurasian mainland and Sakhalin Island are separated by the Strait of Tartary, with its largest island known as Moneron. When an expedition led by La Perouse was exploring these waters in 1787, Paul Merault Monneron, a French engineer officer, discovered a new piece of land; the island was named after him. However, it was only "new" to Europeans; the indigenous people of this area, the Ainu, had known about it for a long time - they called it Todomoshiri ("island of sea lions"). When the Japanese mention the island, they say Kaibato: this name is a reference to the Ainu people.',
